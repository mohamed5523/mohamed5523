## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **BSc graduate in Artificial Intelligence** (Kafr El Sheikh University, 2023, GPA 3.5) with **2+ year of professional AI engineering experience**.

I’ve worked as:

* **AI Engineer in the Military (2024 – present)**
* **Freelance AI Engineer (2022 – 2024)**
* **AI Instructor Online (2023 – 2024)**
* **English Teacher (2019 – 2024)**

My **graduation project** was an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** for detecting and extracting dead bodies, showcasing my ability to combine AI with real-world problems.

I’m actively seeking **Junior or Mid-level AI Engineer roles** to apply my expertise in ML, DL, NLP, and AI-driven automation.
